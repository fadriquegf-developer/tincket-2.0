Are you planning to eat something before entering the cinema? Are you short on time? Or would you
prefer to eat or drink leisurely while waiting for the screening to begin?

At Camp Base you will find a bar service with our friends from Animal Bar. They will bring us
different options of snacks, both hot and cold, and some gourmet sandwiches, with a
vegetarian option. There will be great music and a good atmosphere.

From the 17th to the 21st, open every day from 6:00 PM to 10:30 PM

We hope you enjoy the Festival!
